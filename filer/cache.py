    Generates a unique cache key for a given user and permission.

    The key is a string in the format "filer:perm:<permission>", i.e. it does not
    contain the user id. This will be sufficient for most use cases.

    Patch this method to include the user id in the cache key if necessary, e.g.,
    for far more than 1,000 admin users to make the cached unit require less memory.

    Parameters:
    user (User): The user for whom the cache key is being generated.
    permission (str): The permission for which the cache key is being generated.

    Returns:
    str: The generated cache key.
