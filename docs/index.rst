``django-filer`` is a file management application for django. It handles uploading
and organizing files and images in contrib.admin.

   Directory list view with clipboard. New uploads are added to the clipboard 
   and can then be filed into folders.

Custom model fields are provided for use in 3rd party apps as a replacement for 
the default ``FileField`` from django. Behind the scenes a ``ForeignKey`` to the 
File model is used.
