.. django-filer documentation master file

Welcome to django-filer's documentation!
========================================

``django-filer`` is a file management application for django. It handles uploading
and organizing files and images in contrib.admin.


.. warning::
   This documentation refers to development version of ``django-filer``.
   
   As this version has not been released yet, any part of the API maybe subject
   to modifications without notice, and this documentation may be outdated and
   not in sync with the code.

   Directory list view with clipboard. New uploads are added to the clipboard 
   and can then be filed into folders.

Custom model fields are provided for use in 3rd party apps as a replacement for 
the default ``FileField`` from django. Behind the scenes a ``ForeignKey`` to the 
File model is used.
