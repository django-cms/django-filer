Installation and Configuration
==============================


.. note:: upgrading from 0.8.7? Checkout :ref:`upgrading`.


Getting the latest release
--------------------------

The easiest way to get ``django-filer`` is simply install it with `pip`_::

    $ pip install django-filer

If you are feeling adventurous you can get 
`the latest sourcecode from github <https://github.com/stefanfoulis/django-filer/>`_ or add
http://stefanfoulis.github.com/django-filer/unstable_releases/ to ``find-links`` for the latest
alpha and beta releases.

Dependencies
------------

* `Django`_ >=1.3.1,<1.5
* `django-mptt`_ >=0.5.1,<0.6
* `easy_thumbnails`_ >= 1.0
* `django-polymorphic`_ >=0.2
* `PIL`_ 1.1.7 (with JPEG and ZLIB support) I recommend using `Pillow`_ instead.
* ``django.contrib.staticfiles``

Since the `PIL package on pypi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PIL/>`_ can be notoriously hard to install on some
platforms it is not listed in the package dependencies in ``setup.py`` and won't
be installed automatically. Please make sure you install `PIL`_ with JPEG and
ZLIB support installed. I recommend `Pillow`_ a better
packaged fork of `PIL`_).

Configuration
-------------

Add ``"filer"`` and related apps to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and run ``manage.py syncdb``
(or ``manage.py migrate`` if you're using `South`_).::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'filer',
        'easy_thumbnails',
        ...
    ]



Note that `easy_thumbnails`_ also has database tables and needs a ``syncdb`` or 
``migrate``.

Static media
............

In order to operate properly, django-filer needs some js and css files. They
are located in the ``static/filer`` directory in the ``filer`` package. Use
`django.contrib.staticfiles`_  (or `django-staticfiles`_) to have them
automatically served.


subject location aware cropping
...............................

It is possible to define the *important* part of an image (the 
*subject location*) in the admin interface for django-filer images. This is 
very useful when later resizing and cropping images with easy_thumbnails. The 
image can then be cropped automatically in a way, that the important part of
the image is always visible.

To enable automatic subject location aware cropping of images replace 
``easy_thumbnails.processors.scale_and_crop`` with
``filer.thumbnail_processors.scale_and_crop_with_subject_location`` in the
``THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS`` setting::

    THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS = (
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.colorspace',
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.autocrop',
        #'easy_thumbnails.processors.scale_and_crop',
        'filer.thumbnail_processors.scale_and_crop_with_subject_location',
        'easy_thumbnails.processors.filters',
    )

To crop an image and respect the subject location::
    
    {% load thumbnail %}
    {% thumbnail obj.img 200x300 crop upscale subject_location=obj.img.subject_location %}

permissions
...........

.. WARNING:: File permissions are an experimental feature. The api may change at any time.

See :ref:`permissions` section.

secure downloads
................

See :ref:`secure_downloads` section.

debugging and logging
.....................

While by default ``django-filer`` usually silently skips icon/thumbnail
generation errors,  two options are provided to help when working with ``django-filer``:

 * ``FILER_DEBUG``: Boolean, controls whether bubbling up any ``easy-thumbnails``
   exception (typically if an image file doesn't exists); is ``False`` by default;
 * ``FILER_ENABLE_LOGGING``: Boolean, controls whether logging the above exceptions.
   It requires proper django logging configuration for default logger or
   ``filer`` logger. Please see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/logging/
   for further information about Django's logging configuration.
